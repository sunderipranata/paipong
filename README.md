The super short source code for the ping pong collecting robot (Paipong)

# Dependency
Install OpenCV2 from this link

Find out how yourself because I forget how I did that.

Run all `project.cpp`, Voila! .... you need to build the robot first!

Since I have already totally forgotten how to build it, please figure it out with this documents.
